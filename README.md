## How deos it work

1. We clone the repo:Â `git clone https://github.com/styczynski/chatdb.git`
2. We install dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Now we need to open the browser and navigate to https://chat.openai.com/chat and log in or sign up
4. We need to open console with F12
5. Open Application tab > Cookies
6. Copy the value for `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` and paste that into `OpenAPIAuth(session_token="YOUR SESSION TOKEN")` inside `demo.py`
7. Now the last step is to execute `poetry run python3 demo.py`
